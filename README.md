# Kawaii_Todo_List
## ðŸŒ¸ Project Description

This project was created as part of the ASTUMJS Summer Bootcamp Task 1, where participants were asked to build a responsive and visually appealing To-Do List using only HTML and CSS â€” no JavaScript. The goal was to recreate a kawaii-themed user interface based on a Figma design, focusing purely on frontend layout and styling techniques.

The design features soft pink tones, a rounded input field with an embedded add button, styled task cards, and an optional bunny image to enhance the cuteness of the UI. It also includes mobile responsiveness using media queries to ensure it works smoothly on smaller screens. This project helped reinforce core CSS concepts like layout, positioning, font styling, and responsiveness.
